                            <p>Project:MIT App Inventor</p>
                            <p>Course: CSP(Computer Science Principles)</p>
                            <p>Duration: 2-3 weeks (October 2019)</p>
                            <p>Objective: Create a game based off one of the tutorials that Mr. Brown showed us.</p>
                            <p>Type of Project: Partner Project.</p>

                            <p>For my MIT App Inventor project, we chose mini golf because it was a tutorial of intermediate difficulty, and we didn't want to choose something we weren't ready to handle. We chose mini golf because out of the intermediate options we were considering, we thought mini golf was the most fun. </p>
                            <p>The objective of the game was to create a ball and a hole with obstacles in between to stop the ball from going in to the hole. One of these obstacles was sand. The sand slowed down the ball to a point where after going through it, the golf ball basically no longer moved.</p>
                            <p>Another thing that helped on this project was that my partner and I were able to work exceptionally well with each other, and because of that, there were no problems or miscommunications.</p>
                            <p>One mistake I made in this project which I will be sure to never repeat again is that I didn't fill in the daily log when I was supposed to, and saved it until the end, and it was really difficult because I couldn't remember what happened each day. This showed that procrastination and laziness had consequences because I believe that that is one of the major places where I lost points.</p>
                            <p>Another thing I really learned about in this project is the connection in App Inventor between the design windown and the actual code. It took some time to understand, and I had to ask my partner for help using the design window, but eventually I got a decent understanding of it.</p>

                            <p>Project: Photo Manipulation Project</p>
                            <p>Course: CSP(Computer Science Principles)</p>
                            <p>Duration: 3 weeks (March-April 2020)</p>
                            <p>The objective of our project was to choose four images and then manipulate them to suit the needs of one of the four clients we had the option of choosing.</p>
                            <p>This project was one that I completed individually.</p>
                            <p>Over the duration of this project, I have gained a better understanding of different packages such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) as well as how to combine the logic from various concepts that until now I have used to solve ordinary problems (if statements, functions, etc.) and apply them to different manipulation related code.</p>
                            <p>During this project, there were several obstacles. For instance, if I did not call something in a very specific way, or call it in the right order, it would return an error. An example of this was when I had to write my file paths for whatever reason, if I messed up one letter, the error returned would be that that file does not exist, and I would be confused because I couldn't notice that tiny change. As a result, these errors taught me to be cautious, and as I did more and more coding on this project, the fewer errors I made because I became more and more alert.</p>
