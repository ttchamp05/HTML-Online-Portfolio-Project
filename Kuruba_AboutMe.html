                    <p>Hi, my name is Kaustubh. I am 14 years old and a freshman at Dublin High School. My favorite subject offered at this amazing high school is CSP(Computer Science Principles). Both my parents work as IT professionals, so naturally I wanted to follow in their footsteps. This is why I took CSP, to get an introduction to the various languages in Computer Science. Due to the fact that I was a beginner, this course was a real challenge but I enjoyed it and I still do because it made me realize that these were the challenges I'd have to overcome to become a professional in this industry.</p>
                    <p>When comparing my Scratch Project, MIT App Inventor Project, and my HTML project, I enjoyed actual writing code out far more than I enjoyed block programming. Even though both had their difficulties, I dislike block programming due to the fact that there are only a limited number of options with what you can do and the frustration when you can't find a certain block.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the course of my life, I have always enjoyed activities that require both good speaking skills as well as quick thinking. My hobbies are: playing table tennis, watching Netflix, and playing basketball with my friends at Jordan Ranch Park. My favorite tv show is Daredevil and my favorite movie is Captain America's Civil War. The classes that I am currently registered in are: College Prep English, Computer Science Principles, Freshman Seminar, Spanish 2, Algebra 1, and Biology. Out of all my classes, my favorite is Computer Science Principles.</p>
                    <p>This is because out of all my classes, this class is more than learning a concept, taking a test, passing or failing the course, etc. While CSP does have these things, it also has something more. The things we do in this class are the basics of something that is used to run the world. This fasciantes me and the hope that one day I could be one of those people shaping the world is another thing that made me want to choose an engineering elective.</p>
                    <p>Due to the unfortunate state of the world because of the COVID-19 Outbreak, the government has put in place a mandatory Shelter in Place. Because of this new order, I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. With this free time, I decided to further my knowledge, including and especially those areas in which I have an interest. For me, this area is Computer Science. Over the period of this lockdown, I have done more practice with the concepts we have already learned in class: for loops, while loops, etc. Furthermore, I have decided to go beyond and have begun learning how to code in Python With Turtle.</p>
